## Summary

This proposes an experimental representation for operations on classical bits solely within conditions.
This is not required to be the final design for classical handling in Terra, it is meant to be something simple that doesn't entangle existing Terra objects too closely, so can be deprecated in favour of a more complete system in the future.


## Motivation

- Current hardware is gaining support for runtime operations and subsequent conditions on classical bits
- IBM dynamic-circuits hardware can do bit-level calculations, but there is no way to represent this in Qiskit to pass it on
- In Terra, we need more of a feel for what will actually help us represent more complex classical constructs


## User Benefit

- Users of IBM dynamic circuits will be able to take advantage of the classical-processing capabilities of those systems from within Qiskit
- This support is not limited to IBM so may extend further, but we are not aware of other dynamic-circuits hardware accessible through Qiskit
- For Terra development: this is a "build one to throw away"-type sytem, so we can see in actual usage what works and doesn't for us before we commit to further classical processing.


## Design Proposal

The intent of this RFC is to define an exploratory representation for a simple subset of classical bit-level operations, which expand the current state of Terra's `IfElseOp.condition`.
This representation is not required to be the base for future expansion; it will be permissible to introduce a completely different classical-value type system if that is more appropriate, and deprecate this one.
To that end, this proposal will not include adding any additional public methods to any existing Terra classes that might conflict with an alternative implementation.
In particular, this proposal will not consider adding ease-of-use arithmetic methods to `Clbit` or `ClassicalRegister`, nor will it add expressions that can be used as the parameters to gates.

Notes:

- We want to keep a level of interoperability with the OpenQASM 3 description of hybrid quantumâ€“classical programs, to have better cross-ecosystem compatibility.
  When in doubt, we probably want to run towards the design choices made there.
- There is no _requirement_ to throw this representation away again.
  If it works, we can build on it and keep it.

### Representation

`IfElseOp.condition` and `WhileLoopOp.condition` will expand their allowed values to be an "expression" that evaluates to Boolean.
The allowed expressions will be the following:

- Object:
  - literal `bool` (`True` or `False`);
  - literal `uint[_]` (non-negative Python `int`);
  - runtime `bool` (`Clbit`);
  - runtime `uint[n]` (`ClassicalRegister(size=n)`).
- Unary:
  - `uint[n] -> uint[n]`: bitwise negation
  - `bool -> bool`: Boolean negation
- Binary:
  - `uint[n] * uint[n] -> uint[n]` and `bool * bool -> bool`: `&`, `|`, `^`;
  - `bool * bool -> bool`: `&&`, `||`;
  - `uint[n] * uint[n] -> bool`: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`.

For typing in this initial draft, we will make an exact bijection:

- `ClassicalRegister(size=n)` <=> `uint[n]`
- `Clbit` <=> `bool`

Python Booleans (`True` and `False`) will be used as the `bool` literal values, as they currently are in `Instruction.condition`.
Non-negative Python ints will be used as the `uint` literal values.
These do not have an inherent width.
The width of a literal `uint[_]` will be inferred and fixed to make a containing binary expression validly typed, and mixed-width operations will be forbidden.
A binary expression in this representation _must_ contain at least one type of fixed width; it will be an error to attempt to use the runtime logic on two literals (this simplifies the implementation, and we won't do constant folding).

This is not intended to be a complete set of classical expressions, for simplicity in this initial implementation.
Notably, this MVP will _not_ include:

1. arithmetic on `uint[n]` (`+`, `*`, etc);
2. indexing the bits resulting from one of these rvalue expresions;
3. slicing a `uint[n]` to retrieve a subset of its bits;
4. any method of assigning one of these expressions for reuse elsewhere in the circuit.

Points 1 through 3 are rejected in this initial proposal for the sake of keeping the number of expression-tree nodes and type-system entries small.
Point 4 is rejected because it would require the definition of additional `Operation` objects and potentially modifications to the `QuantumCircuit` class that we are not yet prepared to make.
All of these points are eligible to be included in future work, just not the MVP.


### Construction

#### Stage 1

This is an experimental representation, so it is a non-goal to produce the best possible UX for constructing these objects.
In the initial representation phase, users will be required to build the expression-tree representations themselves.
This will look _something_ like (names up for discussion):

```python
from qiskit.circuit import Clbit, ClassicalRegister
from qiskit.circuit.classical import expr

loose = [Clbit() for _ in [None]*3]
cr1 = ClassicalRegister(2)
cr2 = ClassicalRegister(2)

# Equivalent to the current condition `(cr, 2)`:
equal_reg = expr.Equal(expr.Value(cr1), expr.Value(2))

# Equivalent to the current condition `(loose[0], False)`
equal_bit = expr.Equal(expr.Value(loose[0]), expr.Value(False))

# The above example, but using a Bool-valued unary expression:
not_bit = expr.Not(expr.Value(loose[0]))

# The comparison 0 < cr1 <= cr2
bounded_reg = expr.And(
    expr.Less(expr.Value(0), expr.Value(cr1),
    expr.LessEqual(expr.Value(cr1), expr.Value(cr2),
)
```

These expressions will then be given directly to `IfElseOp` or `WhileLoopOp` in their `condition` fields.
These expressions will not be valid in the general `Instruction.condition` field; we do not want to expand any support for something we are already moving to remove.

For example, a complete condition construction might look like (eliding `expr.Value` calls that could be inferred):
```python
from qiskit.circuit import QuantumCircuit, ClassicalRegister, QuantumRegister
from qiskit.circuit.classical import expr

cregs = [ClassicalRegister(3), ClassicalRegister(3)]
qc = QuantumCircuit(QuantumRegister(3), *cregs)

qc.h(0)
qc.cx(0, 1)
qc.cx(1, 2)
qc.measure([0, 1, 2], cregs[0])
qc.measure([0, 1, 2], cregs[1])
with qc.if_test(expr.And(expr.Less(0, cregs[0]), expr.LessEqual(cregs[0], cregs[1]))):
    # This is the same as the `bounded_reg` comparison above.
    pass
```


#### Stage 2

Looking beyond the initial phase, it will be convenient to define a less verbose way for users to create these expressions.
Since this document is intended to define a representation that can be removed and deprecated from Terra easily if it needs to evolve, we will _not_ consider overloading the Python magic-methods `__and__` etc on `Clbit` and `ClassicalRegister` in general Terra usage.
However, we can do so in a limited scope, which will temporarily change the semantics.
This will look like (continued from above code block, and the same examples in the same order):

```python
with expr.build():
    equal_reg = cr1 == 2
    equal_bit = loose[0] == False
    not_bit = ~loose[0]
    bounded_reg = (0 < cr1) & (cr1 <= cr2)
```

It is not possible to overload the behaviour of the Python Boolean operators (`not`, `and` and `or`) for classes, which is why the bitwise operations `~` and `&` are used instead (with the corresponding precedence frustrations).
Within the `expr.build()` context, the magic methods of `ClassicalRegister` and `Clbit` will be temporarily overridden to be an eager builder interface for the syntax tree given above.
This means that `expr.build()` context can just contain the entire circuit construction without any changes to `QuantumCircuit`; nothing magic happens on exit of the builder context except for tidying up the monkey-patched methods.
For example, it will be valid to do

```python
qc = QuantumCircuit([Qubit()], loose)
with expr.build():
    with qc.if_test(~loose[0]):
        qc.h(0)
```

The reason to require entering the builder context to make the magic methods available is for potential future ease of change/removal/deprecation.
The mutation of global state required to do this makes the builder interface non-thread-safe, but this is not judged to be a problem; it is uncommon to attempt to multithread during manual circuit construction, and the advantages of easy removal/representation change completely outweigh the potential concern.


## Detailed Design

The new functionality will live in `qiskit.circuit.classical`.
The expression-builder objects will all be exposed from `qiskit.circuit.classical.expr`, to allow people to bring the desired values into scope either with a namespace prefix `expr` or by a star-import of limited scope.

> From this point on, I will omit the prefix `qiskit.circuit.classical.`.

The class `expr.Expr` will be an abstract base class with one read-only field:
```python
# file: qiskit/circuit/classical/expr.py

class Expr(ABC):
    type: qiskit.circuit.classical.Type
```

The `type` field is a resolved type of the contained expression.
In this initial release, the only time that `type` will not be a fully qualified type will be when representing a `expr.Value` of a `uint` literal.
Type errors will raise immediately on attempted construction.
In the future, we may consider relaxing this restriction and having a type-evaluation pass that runs on the complete `QuantumCircuit` AST representation, but that is for later work.

The expressions in the above examples will be final (uninheritable) subclasses of `Expr`:
```python
class Value(Expr):
    value: Any

class Less(Expr):
    left: Expr
    right: Expr

...
```

We will supply a base class `ExprVisitor` that can be subclassed to easily handle the double-dynamic dispatch needed to visit the children of an `Expr`.
For an example implementation of a tree visitor, see the Python built-in `ast.NodeVisitor`.


Similarly, the type system will be represented by values of the type `types.Type`:
```python
# file: qiskit/circuit/classical/types.py

class Type(ABC):
    pass

@typing.final
class Bool(Type):
    pass

UNKNOWN = object()

@typing.final
class Uint(Type):
    size: int | Literal[UNKNOWN]
```

In this simple type system, there is likely no need for a `TypeVisitor` class yet, but if the type system expands to include compound types (functions, for example), we can supply one.


### Potential deprecation

If this is needed to be replaced, the module `qiskit.circuit.classical` can just be deprecated, and the replacement can be given a new name.
Since none of this proposal involves new user-facing methods on any existing classes, there will be no trouble with replacing those with new behaviour.
For example, since the magic method `Clbit.__add__` would only be defined when the `expr.build()` context is active, we can simply deprecate `expr.build` to remove the usage of the magic methods.
A new implementation would _immediately_ be able to define new magic methods if desired, instead of needing to go through a full deprecate-and-remove cycle, because `Clbit.__add__` would only be monkey-patched on using the deprecated `expr.build`.


## Implementation plan

PR 1:
- write representation of `Expr` and `Type`
- test that these objects can be constructed and handle type checking correctly

PR 2 (depends on 1):
- add support to `Expr` of evaluated type `Bool` to `IfElseOp.condition` and `WhileLoopOp.condition`

PR 3 (depends on 2):
- add support for exporting these `Expr` conditions to OpenQASM 3 

PR 4 (depends on 2):
- add support for these `Expr` conditions into the `DAGCircuit` <-> `QuantumCircuit` conversions (i.e. enable the transpiler to work with them)

PR 5 (depends on 1):
- add the `expr.build()` context manager

Pull requests 1 through 4 are required for minimal support in a Terra version.
PRs 2 and 3 are semi-parallelisable; the export support can be made prospectively assuming that the `condition` field might be an `Expr`, but the final tests will need PR 2 merged first.
Pull request 5 can be permitted to follow in a subsequent Terra release, if necessary, despite being parallelisable with all PRs following 1.


## Alternative Approaches

### Reuse of `ParameterExpression`

We have talked about using the existing `ParameterExpression` before, for this.
This poses several problems, because overloading it from its current use as a _compile-time_ stand-in for unknown values to involve arbitrary _run-time_ expressions opens the door for many errors where those two domains don't fully align.
`ParameterExpression` is also build on `sympy`/`symengine`, which don't have any sort of rigorous type system for us to use.
We would have to hack one on top of them, which would make a lot more of the manipulation interfaces around these types far more complex to use.
These also perform (by default) aggressive simplifications based on arithmetic operations on the reals; this does not translate cleanly to storing operations on mixed types, or having casts from one type to another, and so on.

### Reuse of `classicalfunction.BooleanExpression`

This type is somewhat more similar to the immediate goals of this PR, but it:

- has hard requirements on being a Python AST walker, which hurts ergonomics for construction of simple conditions (see next comment, and the "call" syntax to apply to given objects would need to implemented still);
- relies on `tweedledum`, which is unmaintained (which is why `qiskit.circuit.classicalfunction` is pending complete removal from Terra);
- cannot easily allow dynamic construction of conditions, since it relies on being a static analyser.

It is also currently only defined for bit types, not the integer types we need for `ClassicalRegister` (despite the existence of `Int2`).
This possibly could be extended, but the other points above are enough reason to dismiss this.


### AST-visitor builder interface

The stage-2 builder interface for the expression syntax given above had a problem that Python does not allow classes to override the behaviour of binary Boolean operations.
This could be avoided instead if we had the builder interface be something like
```python
@expr.build
def _equal_reg(cr: ClassicalRegister):
    return cr == 2

@expr.build
def _bounded_reg(cr1: ClassicalRegister, cr2: ClassicalRegister):
    return 0 < cr1 <= cr2

equal_reg = _equal_reg(cr)
bounded_reg = _bounded_reg(cr1, cr2)
```

This is possible with function decorators because the decorator can access the Python AST of the contained code and rewrite it.
`with` statements still execute, we can just control the context within that happens.

This function-decorator method is not chosen because:

- in practice, since it only applies to expressions and is not part of a larger circuit builder interface, it ends up being much more verbose due to the need to first define, then call;
- it is harder to write and maintain a Python AST visitor, which makes it less ideal for a preliminary implementation
- it has to do type checking twice; once during the AST visit, and once during the subsequent object call.

In the context of a larger circuit-builder interface, where the entirety of the `QuantumCircuit` is built up using such functions, many of the negatives of this form are reduced.


## Future Extensions

- An entire classical system including casting between different types, and the ability to assign runtime expressions to variables that are managed by `QuantumCircuit`.
- An extension of the type system to include values that can be used as the operands of gate objects.

    "### Current Situation\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Current restriction to QUBOs\n",
    "Currently, Qiskit only supports Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems.\n",
    "QUBOs can be mapped to an equivalent operator ground state problem.\n",
    "The corresponding algorithms available in Qiskit (VQE / QAOA) expect an 'Operator' in the constructor that specifies the problem to be solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some problem classes (e.g. TSP, MaxCut, Portfolio, ...), Qiskit provides dedicated translators that take problem parameters and return the corresponding operator.\n",
    "In addition, a more general translator from a `docplex.mp.model.Model` to an `Operator` is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "In principle, `docplex.mp.model.Model` can represent more general types of (quadratic) optimization problems, but since the available algorithms require an `Operator` as input, we are again limited to QUBOs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Missing model flexibility for advanced algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, `docplex.mp.model.Model` models are very convenient to formulate a problem, but not flexible at all once this is done.\n",
    "E.g., it is not possible to substitute particular variables by given values and return a smaller optimization problem, which is a very important functionality for many of our more advanced algorithms (e.g. ADMM, RQAOA, Slack-MBO).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a modular and flexible optimization stack\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal is to increase flexibility and modularity of optimization problems and algorithms.\n",
    "This requries a unified `OptimizationProblem` representation that satisfies the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Easy and intuitive developement of complex optimization problems using a high-level modelling language (e.g. docplex)\n",
    "- Flexible and easy to modify problem representation (e.g. substituting variables, coefficients, etc.)\n",
    "- Efficient scaling to large problems\n",
    "- Generic representation to cover a large set of problem classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we want all `OptimizationAlgorithms` to implement the same interface, i.e., accept an `OptimizationProblem` and return (an extension of) a generic `Solution`.\n",
    "An algorithm should throw an exception if it is given an unsupported `OptimizationProblem` (common practise in classical optimization)."

    "# Proposal & Possible implementations\n",

    "In the following, we outline the general idea for a modular and flexible optimization stack.\n",
    "This supports quantum (pure & hybrid) but also classical algorithms, and by streamlining the interfaces supports efficient modeling, testing, validation, benchmarking, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "We suggest to split the stack into three classes, each responsible for a well-defined task:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `OptimizationProblem` for specifying, representing, modifying the problem to be solved\n",
    "- `OptimizationAlgorithm` to find/approximate the optimal solution of an `OptimizationProblem`\n",

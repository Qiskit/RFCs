## Summary

Balancing stable backward compatibility with the rapid pace of technology is a crucial consideration for Qiskit. This RFC is a public discussion that aims to find a harmonious solution that offers users a clear and transparent support contract while minimizing the burden on developers and users. Ideally, we are in  the search for an approach that also maximizes flexibility to accommodate new hardware and services, which often necessitate the development of new features.


## Motivation

Qiskit is known for its dynamic nature and frequent deprecation of features. However, the [deprecation policy](https://qiskit.org/documentation/deprecation_policy.html) places a strong emphasis on stability and guarantees a relatively lengthy transition period (usually longer than six months from the first notification point on) when removing a feature. For the past several years Qiskit has also had planned releases on a regular schedule for mitigating the impact of coming changes, as well as pre-releases to enable testing prior to a final release.

However, there is a demand for a more transparent release cycle with longer periods of backwards compatibility support. In order to get ready for a "beyond Qiskit 0.x", a discussion on how that cycle would like is key to understand the trade-offs among:

 * developer effort: Supporting several stable versions requires significant development resources. At the same time, rolling releases tend to create technical debt and fewer chances to enable re-architecting features or interfaces for better maintainability or changing needs.
 * user support: users tend to demand longer support periods to avoid regular updates in their code and software.
 * new feature support for coming technology: the quantum computing field and hardware is constantly changing and scaling up. This can require changes in Qiskit, which are not always compatible with previous approaches.

The outcome of the RFC is an agreement for release cycle and a versioning schema that would provide users with the tools for planning and stability while reduce the impact in the development workflow.

## User Benefit

The RFC aims to benefit users and Qiskit ecosystem developers, because they will have guaranties that their software will run for a defined period of time and they could plan the transition period. 

## Design Proposal

The current `0.*`-release cycle increases the minor version in approximate periods of 3 months on a scheduled basis and, with the exception of the pre-release period (from one to two weeks) does not support more than one stable version at the time, i.e. the support of `0.X` finishes with the release of `0.X+1`.

The `0.*`-release branch scheme is like this:

    commit id:"feature/0"
    commit id: "ready_for_release" type:HIGHLIGHT
    branch stable/0.X
    commit id: "tag_0.X.0rc1" tag: "v0.X.0rc1"
    checkout main
    commit id:"bugfix/1"
    checkout stable/0.X
    cherry-pick id:"bugfix/1"
    commit id: "tag_0.X.0" tag: "v0.X.0"
    checkout main
    commit id:"feature/1"
    commit id:"feature/2"
    commit id:"bugfix/2"
    checkout stable/0.X
    cherry-pick id:"bugfix/2"
    checkout main
    commit id:"feature/3"
    commit id:"bugfix/3"
    checkout stable/0.X

    checkout main
    commit id:"feature/4"
    checkout stable/0.X
    commit id: "tag_0.X.1" tag: "v0.X.1"
```

The main branch is a single development branch from which some bugfixes are backported to the stable branch, from which releases are done.


The new release cycle will include:

 * [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html)
 * Critical bugfix support for at least one year
 * 6-month transition period for updating to a new major while having support.
 * Non-breaking new features releases in a 3-month cycle (as currently)

Similarly to the current branching model, non-breaking features (`feature/*`) and bug fixes (`bugfix/*`) can be merged into `main` at any point. Non-breaking features (`feature/*`) are released in minor releases, when branched out of `main` for `tag_X.*`. Bug fixes are cherry-picked from main into the respective `stable/X.*` branch.

The main difference with the `0.*`-release schema is that breaking changes cannot be introduced at any point, but only between major releases (for example, from `X.Y.Z` to `X+1.0.0`.

## Detailed Design

All the stability guarantees on this RFC are on *public APIs*. Users and developers are encourage to only use public API and do not hook on internal interfaces.

### Definition of *public API*

The Qiskit public API is considered any documented module, class, function, or method that is not marked as private (with a `_` prefix).

**Exceptions**:

 - Experimental interfaces: If module, class, function, or method is documented as experimental that is not marked as private (with a `_` prefix). Experimental interfaces have to raise a user visible [Warning](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html) (exact Warning type to be define). 
 - Abstract interface definitions: These APIs are created to define an interface to be implemented by a subclass. Methods and properties defined as private in these Abstract classes are part of the public API.
 - Low-level methods for advanced usage: There are private methods that have stable interfaces but are not considered safe to use
as the burden is on the user to uphold the class/safety invariants themselves
(the canonical example of this is the `QuantumCircuit._append` method).


### Versioning Model

The proposed versioning model for Qiskit aligns with [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), providing a clear and standardized approach to version numbering. This model aims to communicate the nature of changes on the public API in each release, helping users and developers understand the impact of an update at a glance.

Semantic Versioning consists of three version components: *Major*, *Minor*, and *Patch* versions, represented as `X.Y.Z`. Each component has a specific meaning in the context of Qiskit:

**Major Version (X):** Increments for backward-incompatible changes, indicating potential breaking changes that may require modifications in user code using the public API.

- A major version `X` release has a minimum of 18 month period for support with critical bug fixes.
- New major release `X` can introduce breaking changes with respect to previous major release `X-1`.
- During the `X` release series, there might include non-breaking new features during that period.
- After the release of a major release `X`, `X+1` can be released after, at least, 12 months.
- After the release of `X+1`, `X` wont have new features and only critical bugfixes are provided for, at least, 6 months.
- The features deprecated during the period of support with `X` will be removed in `X+1`

**Minor Version (Y):** Increases for backward-compatible features or enhancements a new `X.Y` release:

- Minor releases are planned for every 3 months, on a best effort basis.
- Users can expect new functionalities without breaking existing code (with the exception of Experimental APIs.
- Significant refactorings of internals without changes in the public API are possible in minor releases.
- Bugfixing without changes in the public API are possible in minor releases.
- Deprecation of previous functionality might be introduced (with a `DeprecationWarning` and documentation), pointing to the new prefer way or alternative, if there is one.
- The support of `X.Y` finishes with the release of `X.Y+1` in most of the cases (exception might apply)
- The minor release before the next major (aka, *final minor release*) has support for 6 months after the next major. That is, if `X.Y` is the last feature release before `X+1.0`, then `X.Y+1` is the final minor release.
- The final minor release `X.Y+1` should not have new features but might include `DeprecationWarning`s that will be removed in the next major, `X+1.0`. 

**Patch Version (Z):** Bumps for backward-compatible bug fixes.

- New `Z` releases have no scheduled and they are done on a *need-base* considering:
  - The *backportability* of the patch
  - The severity of the bug to fix
  - The criticality of the affected use-case
- Cannot be introduced in patch releases:
  - new deprecation warnings
  - new features of any kind
  - raise minimum requirements for using or building Qiskit (including adding new dependencies)
  - any kind of changes in any kind of public API (including Experimental APIs), including its removal or expansion.
- It may include:
  - expansive support for new versions of Python, Rust, or run/build environment
  - support for new versions of other existing dependencies
- The support of `X.Y.Z` finishes with the release of `X.Y.Z+1` (or `X.Y+1.0`) in most of the cases (exception might apply)
- After the release of `X+1`, bugfixing is provided via `X.Y.Z+N` in undetermined regularity for 6 months. 

### Git branching model

Before the release of a major `X.0`, the last minor `X-1.Y` should be tagged in the `stable/X-1.Y`. Two weeks before the release `X.0` the branch `next/X` should be merged into `main` (probably not necessary the first time). Then `stable/X.0` is branched from `main`, as well as `next/X+1`. In `stable/X.0`, `X.0.0rc1` is tagged and release. Two week later, at stable release time, `X.0.0` is tagged on `stable/X.0` and released.

Similarly, two week before the release of `Y` minor, a `stable/X.Y` branch from `main` is created, from where `X.Y.0rc1` is tagged. When stable `X.Y.0` will be released (two weeks later), the label is on `stable/X.Y`.

All changes, including bug fixes, with backward compatibility are PRed with `main` as base. Bugfix PRs that are possible to port to stable should be tagged as `stable-backport-potential` and a bot ports them to `stable/X.Y` (where `Y` is the last minor).
At undefined time, a new patch release `X.Y.Z` is tagged on `stable/X.Y` and released.

Non-backward compatible changes, including removal of deprecated code, can be PRed at any point against `next/X+1` branch.

Regularly, `main` should be merge into `next/X+1` to keep it up-to-date. The suggestion is for every minor release, at least.

### QPY support

The QPY serialization format is backwards compatible so that a new Qiskit can release can always load a QPY
file generated with an earlier release of Qiskit. However, the format isn't forward compatible, so it's not possible
to load QPY files generated with newer version of Qiskit using an older release. To support compatibility across major version releases, the `qiskit.qpy.dump()` function has an optional argument `version` that lets a user specify a back version of the QPY format emitted by the `dump()` function. There are two constants exposed by
the `qpy` module, `qiskit.qpy.QPY_VERSION` which documents the default format version emitted by `dump()` and
also the maximum version that `load()` supports, and `qiskit.qpy.QPY_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION` which documents the minimum version that `dump()` can emit (while `load()`  can load any version <= `QPY_VERSION`).

To facilitate user migration across major version releases the `qiskit.qpy.dump()` function will always support at least one overlapping version between the `X.0.0` and the `X-1.Y.0` release (where Y is the last minor version of 
that series). This will enable saving QPY format files that can be loaded by both major versions from the newer
release. For example, in Qiskit 1.0.0 the `QPY_VERSION` was `11`, and in Qiskit 0.46.0 the `QPY_VERSION` constant was `10`. For qiskit 1.0.0 the minimum version supported by `dump()`'s `version` argument, and exposed by 
`qiskit.qpy.QPY_COMPATIBILITY_VERSION` was 10. This enabled Qiskit 1.0.0 to generate qpy payloads that could
be loaded by Qiskit 0.46.0.

### Pre-releases

The pre-release model from the `0.*`-release cycle will continue in the same way. Two weeks before the release of a minor `X.Y`, a release candidate `X.Yrc0` will be released as a pre-release. The final minor release might be except for that release candidate release, as it does not include new features.

### Feature, deprecation, and removal proposal deadline

Two weeks before the pre-release or a minor release, what ever is before, there will be a feature, deprecation, and removal proposal deadline. That means that any PR with addition, removal, or modification on the public API needs to be ready for review in the Qiskit repository before that date. Exceptions might apply at consideration of the Qiskit core team.

 
### Suggested upgrade path

Users should upgrade minors and patch versions as soon as the next stable release happens in every case, except when there is a new major release.
Major releases allow for 6 months to transition from `X` to `X+1`.
Users and downstreamers should depend on `<X+1` until the end of the transition time.
The last minor on `X` is will contain all the `DeprecationWarning`s users should solve before moving on `X+1`.

If there is a dependency on a feature introduced in `Y`, users should depend on `>=X.Y,<X+1` (or `~=X.Y`). `DeprecationWarning`s introduced on `X.Y` will have an alternative path in `X.Y` and can be migrated then, when possible.

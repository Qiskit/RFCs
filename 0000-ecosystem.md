## Summary
> One paragraph explanation of the feature.

The Qiskit Ecosystem consists of projects, tools, utilities, libraries and tutorials from a broad community of developers and researchers. The goal of the Ecosystem is to celebrate, support and accelerate development of quantum technologies using Qiskit.

**TODO**: intro to tiers.

## Motivation
> - Why are we doing this?
> - What will this enable?
> - What will be the outcome?
> - Who will benefit?

 * Qiskit, being an SDK, is as successful as its ecosystem.
 * Qiskit is built to build on top:
    * an independent module is better than a PR. Qiskit core has maintenance expectation from the core team
    * a way to experiment/incubate
 * Why should you join the Qiskit Ecosystem? See https://medium.com/qiskit/introducing-the-qiskit-ecosystem-join-today-85e79620bef

## User Benefit
> - Who are the target users of this work?
> - How will users or contributors benefit from the work proposed?

For Qiskit users:
 * Realistic expectations about each project support.

For Qiskit Ecosystem developers: A platform to highlight their work. Optionally participate on active alerts to provide support. more visibility while keeping ownership.

## Design Proposal
> This is the focus of the document. Explain the proposal from the perspective of
> educating another user on the proposed features.
> 
> This generally means:
> 
> - Introducing new concepts and nomenclature
> - Using examples to introduce new features
> - Implementation and Migration path with associated concerns
> - Communication of features and changes to users
> 
> Focus on giving an overview of impact of the proposed changes to the target
> audience.
> 
> Factors to consider:
> 
> - Performance
> - Dependencies
> - Maintenance
> - Compatibility

The following tiers are suggested:

 * Main
 * Extensions:
   * Must: IBM Quantum sponsored (written or driven by IBMer)
 * Community:
   * Musts: Open-source projects

## Detailed Design
> Technical reference level design. Elaborate on details such as:
> 
> - Implementation procedure
>   - If spans multiple projects cover these parts individually
> - Interaction with other features
> - Dissecting corner cases
> - Reference definition, eg., formal definitions.

## Alternative Approaches
> Discuss other approaches to solving this problem and why these were not
> selected.

## Questions
> Open questions for discussion and an opening for feedback.

## Future Extensions
> Consider what extensions might spawn from this RFC. Discuss the roadmap of
> related projects and how these might interact. This section is also an opening
> for discussions and a great place to dump ideas.
> 
> If you do not have any future extensions in mind, state that you cannot think
> of anything. This section should not be left blank.

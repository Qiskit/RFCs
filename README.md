# Qiskit RFCs

The purpose of a Qiskit Request for Comments (RFC) is to communicate and engage
with the wider community in the development and direction of Qiskit. RFCs enable
engineering and research stakeholders to communicate design changes to any
component of the larger Qiskit project.

Many changes, including bug fixes and documentation improvements can be
implemented and reviewed via the normal GitHub pull request workflow.

Some changes though are "substantial", and we ask that these be put through a
bit of a design process and produce a consensus among the Qiskit community and
the sub-teams.

This repository is for any project in the Qiskit project to make these design
proposals and review and discuss the changes. An RFC can be contained to a
single project or it can span multiple projects, if a design decision requires
some planning and discussion before implementation an RFC can be used to
facilitate that and collect feedback prior to implementation.
